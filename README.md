Risk versus Safety

The identification of safety and risk factors within a family structure is the number one priority 
for a caseworker when conpleting a comprehesive assesment.
Risk factors will impact a child's developement in the **future**.
Safety factors will impact a child's well-being **immediately**.
A plan is implemented to bring about long term **change** when facing risk factors.
A plan is implemented to **control** safty factors immediately.

To determine if a situation is a safety factor it must meet five criteria.
It must be:

-Serious

-Oberservable and Specific

-Out of Control

-Vunerable Child

-Imminent Danger

Once safety factors are identified a plan must be created to control them.

The plan can include four options:
1. Seperation from the situation

   -the child leaves the situation
  
    -the perpetrator leaves the situation
  
2. Crisis Services

    -an in-home service that can immediately contorl the situation
 
3. Financial Resources

    -Financial assistance is provided which immediately controls the safety factor.
    
4. Community Resources

    -The family is connected to a community resource which immediately provides assitance.
    
The family must be in agreement with the plan to address the safety factors.  
The plan must be reviewed every thrity days as well.  
If there is no change to the safety factors, court proceedings may need to be initiated.
